Arduino "Robot" Halloween Costume with NeoPixel LED, buttons, and sound effects.  21 animations and a very special  self-destruct sequence designed by my son.

## Overview
The costume was designed primarily around a 24-NeoPixel ring and two 8-NeoPixel strips.  A greeting card speaker was added for sound effects, and a 5 pushbutton module was added for controls.

There are 15 animation patterns for the main pixel ring and 6 for the side strips.  The sound effects include random "robot" tones, and various pitch up/down effects, and explosion / random noise.
